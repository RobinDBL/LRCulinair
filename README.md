## Technologies used

This website uses angular as a frontend.

No backend is needed since nothing is sent back to the server. Although with one exception: The contact page uses an external api to send the emails. This external api is a self developed webapp. 

## Github

This project has a clone on github. the main development has taken place on gitlab. Github has an action that just builds the project on both master and development branch. 

## Gitlab

The project has been developed on my personal gitlab server. The CI/CD pipeline is used here most effectively. The pipeline creates a docker container from on the development and master branch.
